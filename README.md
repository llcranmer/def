# OS hw 3 

To use this program open a terminal and then, 

a.) ./run.sh
    - By default the two inputs from Piazza will be used; input3a.txt and input3b.txt, respectively via I/O redirection.
    - It will take a minute or two 
    - look for the newly created 'output3bt.txt' as it allow one to watch as the program is couting to it

b.) To run different tests uncomment out the desired ones in the 'run.sh' file-- Tests were collected from Piazza, which had the Professor's approval. 
    - Edit and add tests as desired 

c.) Compare the results as they are outputed to their respective files, e.g. input3a.txt ==> input3at.txt (notice the t) 
    - compare the input3at.txt with the output3a.txt provided by the professor which are in the format of "output.." (doesn't have the t)

d.) N.B. that for Input3b.txt it is a non-deterministic file and therefore the delays may fluctuate between 1 and 2 in the corresponding output3bt.txt file.
